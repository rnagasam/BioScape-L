Attempt at an implementation of a (simplified) version of
BioScape^L [1].


Notes

Erlang repr:

       TERM ::= { null }
              | { send, Chan, Msg, TERM }
	      | { recv, Chan, Msg, TERM }
	      | { new, Chan, TERM }
	      | { spawn, [ TERM ] }
	      | { repeat, TERM }

Channels need to be killed after all processes terminate.  Create a
`simul' process that monitors processes.  When a process terminates,
it sends a { done } message to `simul'.  After receiving a { done }
from every process, `simul' kills all created channels.
